BookListTableViewController
=======
BookListTableViewController

	Display a notificaiton when curl fails
	
	Use Asynchronous curls
	
	Adjust header when adding a book
	
	Delete works but server response with an error
	
	
Most time consuming part of this project was implementing POST /books. I spent at least 10 to 15 hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my code and trying a variety of ways to fix it. I was finally able to get it to work when I tried POST /books/.
